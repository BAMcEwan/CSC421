Q1:

See code in GameNim.java and StateNim.java for answer to this question

Q2:

As suggested in the problem hint let's define out variables in terms of "term-slots",
so the courses themselves are the variables. Note for simplicity we will write
the courses out not by their numbers but as x0, x1, x2, etc... and define the
value of these variables as xi = (term, termslot, timeslot), where 0=<i<=n

V = (x0, x1, x2, ..., xn), where n is total number of courses

Each part of these variables has a domain:
    Dterm = {term0, term1, term2, ..., termk}, where k is number of terms
    Dtermslot = {ts0, ts1, ts2, ts3}
    Dtimeslot = {t0, t1, t2, ..., tl}, where l is number of time slots in a day

We will now use these domains to formalize the constraints one at a time:

1. Courses might have prerequisite courses that need to to be taken before
    If xi is prerequisite to xj then term(x1) < term(x2) (where i,j are arbitrary indices)
    (if xi = prereq(xj) then xi.term < xj.term)

2. Some course are offered in certain times only
    If xi has only 1 timeslot tj then timeslot(tj) = xi (where i,j are arbitrary indices)
    (if xi.timeslot = {tj} then tj = xi)

3. We want to take not more than 4 course per term.
    We actually take care of this constraint in the formulation of the domain for termslot.
    However, lets formalize it anyways:
    (xi.timeslot = ti where i is positive integer and i<5)

4. Time conflicts should be avoided
    (If xi.timeslot = xj.timeslot = tk then (tk = xi || tk = xj) && tk != {xi, xj})

All together:
C = {
        (if xi = prereq(xj) then xi.term < xj.term),
        (if xi.timeslot = {tj} then tj = xi),
        (xi.timeslot = ti where i is positive integer and i<5),
        (If xi.timeslot = xj.timeslot = tk then (tk = xi || tk = xj) && tk != {xi, xj})
    }

Q3:
See code in CSPZebra.java.

The zebra lives in the fifth house, and water is drunk in the first house.
